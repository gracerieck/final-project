            <h2>ARTICLE:</h2>
            <h3><strong>KELSEY HABERIN, GLOBOPHOBIA</strong></h3>

            <p>If you go to Kelsey Haberin’s birthday you will notice one thing missing: balloons. While most people think that balloons make the party, for Kelsey, they're her worst nightmare.</p>

            <p>The junior Communications major from Pennington, NJ has an intense fear of balloons. Like most phobias, Kelsey developed her extreme anxiety of balloons as a child. “It was my 4th birthday,” she explained. Her mother had covered the walls of their house with many colorful balloons for the big day. However, when someone open a door, a balloon popped right above Kelsey’s head, sending her into a shock.</p>

            <p>The fear of balloons is a verified condition known as globophobia. When Kelsey first heard the term globophobia from a friend, her response was, “I’m afraid of the earth? What?” And Kelsey isn’t alone; there are many people that suffer from globophobia. In fact, there are Facebook pages and Tumblr blogs dedicated to raising awareness. When informed that Oprah Winfrey also had globophobia Kelsey laughed, “it’s like we’re the same person.”</p> 

            <p>Her fear and anxiety makes her uncomfortable, and noticeably affects her behavior. At parties she avoids balloons like the plague. When she sees a child playing with a balloon she becomes extremely anxious, usually working herself up and eventually breaking out in hives. While children often outgrow their phobias, Kelsey’s fear has followed her into adulthood. But as she’s become older it’s become easier to manage her globophobia. “Its not like I’m going to be going to Chuck E. Cheese birthday parties any time soon,” she jokes.</p>

            <p>Relatives and friends have differing reactions to Kelsey’s globophobia. When asked what her parents think about her fears Kelsey said, “They are understanding to a degree. Its not like they bring home balloons to tease me. But when I have a panic attack my mom’s like, ‘you’re not my daughter.’ ” Tyler Hoppe, Kelsey’s childhood friend of since the 3rd grade, is a bit more accommodating. “Since the fear only applies to latex balloons, I must always spend a few extra dollars on the metallic balloons when I (rarely) have to buy balloons for her.”</p>

            <p>Kelsey’s least favorite thing about balloons is when they pop. The loud noise startles her and often sends her into a panic. But, for her, a close second is when someone rubs his or her fingers on a balloon. She attempted to demonstrate by petting an imaginary balloon with her fingers while making a noise that was a cross between a pterodactyl screech and nails on a chalkboard.</p>

            <p>The trick is surrounding herself with people who know and understand her fears. “Its very rare to come across balloons in the wild,” she rationalized. But middle school was the hardest for Kelsey to get through. “There would be balloons in the hallways for pep rallies and stuff. Definitely at pep rallies,” she recalls, “because everyone was pumped up and they’re popping balloons, and I’m like, ‘guys we don’t need to do this.  We have enough pep.’ And they would just be breaking them all. It was the worst.”</p>

            <p>Unlike most people, Kelsey has yet to personally meet someone with the same fear as her. When asked if she thinks her fear is irrational she chuckled and shook her head. “I think it’s a silly one. It’s just funny. Like people are afraid of spiders and that makes sense, but balloons?” she shrugs. “It makes me unique.”</p>

            <h2>INTERVIEW:</h2>
            <h3><strong>Michael Bergamini; 20, Junior, Marketing major, Music Industry minor (Brooklyn, NY)</strong></h3>

            <p>Grace: Hi Michael. I appreciate you sitting down with me and explaining your six-word memoir.</p>

            <p>Michael: It’s my pleasure.</p>

            <p>Grace: Do you mind if I record this session?</p>

            <p>Michael: Not at all.</p>

            <p>Grace: Some people don't understand your memoir, "Hayley Williams. Jeremy Davis. Taylor York". Can you explain the reference?</p>

            <p>Michael: The three names are simply the names of the members of Paramore. Their music has become such an intricate part of my life, that the music they create sums up my life in a clear and succinct way. </p>

            <p>Grace: When did you start listening to Paramore?</p>

            <p>Michael: I started listening to Paramore in the eighth grade. They released their second album, RIOT!, in 2007 which included singles such as “That's What You Get”, “Misery Business”, and “crushcrushcrush”.</p>

            <p>Grace: What is your favorite song and why?</p>

            <p>Michael: This is always the hardest question about Paramore. I could never pick my favorite song, because they all have a distinct message and resonant with me in a different way. My favorites to hear live are “Let the Flames Begin” and “Emergency”. If they play an acoustic show, I love to hear “Misguided Ghosts”. But a favorite one as a whole, that's impossible.</p>

            <p>I can't quite explain why I especially love them, at least not to someone else. Perhaps because they have their own style but still have so much diversity. But the easiest way for me to explain my love for Paramore is that when I listen to them I feel at home, and no other band or singer has done that for me before. </p>

            <p>Grace: If you could take one Paramore lyric and apply it to your life, what would it be?</p>

            <p>Michael: "It's just a spark, but it's enough to keep me going." It’s from a song called “Last Hope”. I met Paramore on June 21, 2014 and had Hayley Williams write out this lyric and I got it tattooed on my leg. </p>

            <p>Grace: How has Paramore defined your life?</p>

            <p>Michael: In more ways then you can even imagine. Their music has showed me that its okay to be pissed off and mad about conflicts with friends (or even bandmates) and to enjoy happiness and the joys that life has to offer. They have been there for even high and low in my life. </p>

            <p>Grace: Has Paramore influence your choice of major/minor? </p>

            <p>Michael: Bands like this have made my interest in music flourish. I declared a Marketing major and Music Industry minor because I want to work for a record label to help new bands start their own musical journey.</p>

            <p>Grace: If you could work for/with the band, what position would you want?</p>

            <p>Michael: I want to be the Marketing Director for their record label, Fueled By Ramen. I am currently part of the street team for this label, so I go to concerts and help promote artists on the label to the general population. It has been one of the best experiences of my life.</p>

            <p>Grace: Wow, thank you for letting me experience your passion and love for Paramore.</p>

            <p>Michael: No problem.</p>
