<h2><strong>Race-based Residential Segregation:</strong></h2>
<h2><strong>A Characteristic of Racial Inequality in the United States</strong></h2>

    <p>Racial segregation is a phenomenon with complex historical roots.  The legacy of discriminatory housing policies has continued even after Congress passed the federal Fair Housing Act (codified at 42 U.S.C. 3601-3619, penalties for violation at 42 U.S.C. 3631), Title VIII of the Civil Rights Act of 1968.  However, even with federal law and enforcement, race-based residential segregation is still practiced.  This paper depicts how race-based residential segregation remains a distinguishing characteristic of racial inequality in the United States.</p>
    <p>Throughout the last century, residential segregation has been a prominent feature among African Americans in the United States.  Researchers have studied why no other ethnic group in the United States has been segregated and/or isolated to the extent of how blacks are segregated.  The co-examination of the Civil Rights Act of 1866 and the Fair Housing Act of 1968 led to a slew of theories about the topic of race-based residential segregation.  While the Civil Rights Act of 1866 incorporated wording that could have been construed as a fair housing policy, the Act did not contain provisions that would have provided federal backing of the policy (Civil Rights Act, 1866).</p>
    <p>With the passage of the Fair Housing Act in 1968, many assumed that race-based residential segregation would end because it introduced several federal enforcement provisions.  The Fair Housing Act also had more explicit language that made acts of discrimination in rental and/or sale of dwellings illegal; Section 804 specifically outlines the legality of “discrimination in sale or rental of housing and other prohibited practices” (The Fair Housing Act, 1968).</p>
	<p>Marc Seitles speculated that the residential segregation of blacks is the result of a series of decisions made due to social, political, and economic influences throughout the 20th century.  Notably, after World War I and World War II, large quantities of blacks moved to the Northern region of the United States in search of jobs in the industrial communities; thus, the formation of urban ghettos occurred (Seitles, 1998).  Researchers also theorized that whites used segregation as a way to consolidate and maintain power during the great African American migration to the North.  The white-black binary formed from white resistance of black neighbors and the practice of discrimination in real estate markets (Burch, 2014; Charles, 2003).</p>
	<p>Even as a tool for white power, African American residential segregation led to the normative practice of segregation still used today with damaging effects (Dawkins, 2004).  For example, segregation is linked to urban poverty and a lack of affordable housing in safer, white-majority, suburban communities (Seitles, 1998).  Burch (2014) asserted that “segregation does not just concentrate poverty however; it also helps reproduce it” (p. 233).</p>
	<p>Another theory examines the history of black-white segregation in the United States.  Researchers argue that residential segregation worsens economic and social issues for African Americans by creating a lower class (Massey & Denton, 1998).  Burch (2014) furthered this theory by asserting that social isolation drove unemployment up in black communities because middle class blacks would move out of all black neighborhoods to live closer to their jobs; therefore, leaving all lower class blacks stuck in the segregated neighborhoods.  With white avoidance of black ghettos, housing worth was destabilized which, in turn, led to low community wealth.</p>
	<p>Charles (2003) hypothesized that racial residential discrimination fostered concentrated poverty in segregated black communities.  Other social issues soon followed poverty, such as low high school graduation rates, high unemployment, concentrated teenage pregnancy and single parenthood, high rates of alcohol and drug abuse, low income and homeownership, and higher rates of violence and victimization (Charles, 2003; Dawkins, 2004; Massey & Denton, 1998; Nelson, Dawkins & Sanchez, 2004).</p>
	<p>According to most researchers, results indicate that racial residential segregation did not begin to end with the signing of the Fair Housing Act in April of 1968.  Furthermore, while most researchers agree to the continued prevalence of residential segregation, they cannot agree on the causes – the how and why – of the situation.</p>
	<p>Seitles (1996) discusses the harmful effects that race-based residential segregation has on minority groups.  However, while the economic and social effects of discrimination are far reaching among all minorities in the United States, Seitles solely targets the harmfulness it has towards blacks.  For this particular paper, because it has an exclusive focus on African Americans, the research is useful, but this source would not be helpful to research aimed at other minority groups, such as, Asians, American Indians, and Hispanics.</p>
    <p>Seitles (1996) is also distinguishable for the explanations of historical segregation of housing in the United States through the development of residential segregation, the urban ghetto, the role of government, the perpetuation of residential segregation, and private discrimination.  Overall, while exceedingly appropriate and applicable, Seitles is outdated.  Newer, contemporary research has made some of Seitles’ work about policy reasons to support residential integration and inclusionary remedies to residential segregation unusable and out-of-date.</p>
	<p>Charles (2003) is a thorough resource in regards to the social context of residential segregation; however, it completely neglects the historical circumstances of residential discrimination.  Furthermore, Charles concentrates on formation of ethnic ghettos through “racial disparities in homeownership and wealth accumulation” (p. 197).  Coupled with Burch (2014), who directs attention to the economic effects of African American that leads to high poverty rates within cities, Charles (2003) is an invaluable source of determining how segregation reproduces poverty, which, in turn, forms ghettos from social circumstances.</p>
	<p>Another source focusing on the singularity of black segregation in the United States, Massey and Denton (1998) links African American poverty to the race-based residential segregation experienced in cities.  Perpetuated by individual actions, institutional practices, and governmental policies, Massey and Denton argue that the concentration of African American segregation in urban ghettos is due to black poverty and lack of upward mobility to escape disenfranchised neighborhoods.  While engaging and thought provoking, Massey and Denton fail to recognize and address the multiple other causes of residential segregation.</p>
    <p>To balance the narrow focus the factors of residential segregation of Massey and Denton (1998), Dawkins (2004) examines for recent causes for race-based residential segregation.  Dawkins examines factors including racial prejudice, racial differences in tastes for housing services, racial differences in housing market information, racial income differences, and housing market discrimination.  Importantly, Dawkins asserts that only a small percentage of residentially segregated minorities, including African Americans, is due to the economics, social context, and demographics of the discriminated group.</p>
	<p>Nelson, Dawkins, and Sanchez (2004) address the purpose of traditional land-use and how modern regulations limit impoverished and minorities from finding available and affordable housing in certain neighborhoods.  Nelson, Dawkins, and Sanchez assert that this type of urban containment, the policy of preventing developments outside an urban community, attempts to eliminate residential segregation by having all races living in the same areas.  However, Nelson, Dawkins, and Sanchez only apply their model to 242 of all 381 Metropolitan Statistical Areas in the United States (Nelson, Dawkins, & Sanchez, 2004).  This can lead to an unknown margin of error and can only give preliminary statistical information about the effectiveness of urban containment in reducing residential segregation.  In order to be admissible, Nelson, Dawkins, and Sanchez should conduct a nationwide survey with their model to all Metropolitan Statistical Areas.</p>
    <p>The future of research in the area of the residential segregation of African Americans should focus more on the motive behind the action rather than the overall causes and results.  It needs to be investigated why a society can continue to practice residential segregation on such a large scale even after Congress passed the federal Fair Housing Act (1968).</p>
	<p>A considerable source of residential segregation is the use of microaggression as a means of discrimination.  Sue (2007) defines racial microaggressions as “brief and commonplace daily verbal, behavioral, or environmental indignities, whether intentional or unintentional, that communicate hostile, derogatory, or negative racial slights and insults towards people of color” (p. 273).  Notably, microaggressors are often unaware that they inflicted harm upon someone else.  Microaggressions are repeatedly the similar missing factor across all researchers because it is an unconscious action.</p>
	<p>Some people who lease, rent, or sell houses can disguise their discrimination through false information or legal ambiguity.  Victims often do not know that they were misled; they were simply told that there was no available housing or they were directed to a certain area based on their race (Dawkins, 2004).  Further research into the microaggressions of the residential segregation needs to be conducted to determine the frequency of these racial discriminations.</p>
    <p>Similarly, white privilege is another widely neglected source of race-based residential segregation.  White privilege is the benefits experienced by white people that are not experienced by non-whites of the same gender, social class, financial circumstances, and political party (Johnson 2005).  “White privilege gives whites little reason to pay attention to African Americans or how white privilege affects them” (p. 22).  As such, whites do not recognize or acknowledge that race-based residential segregation still exists in the United States because they are not affected by it.  Therefore, white privilege can lead to white ideas of deserved discrimination, internalized oppression of blacks, and acts of microaggression.  Future investigations into the overall effects of white privilege against non-whites, especially African Americans, in residential segregation needs to be researched.</p>
    <p>Racial segregation creates a cycle of poverty in which African American can become trapped.  Through low income, low high school graduation rates, high unemployment, concentrated alcohol and drug abuse, et cetera, race-based residential segregation prevents generations of blacks from the dignity of homeownership.  Even after the federal Fair Housing Act of 1968 was signed, urban ghettos have grown and prevailed reinforcing segregation in the housing market, which limits available housing for African Americans.  In turn, it creates less of an opportunity to escape segregated neighborhoods, preventing black families from finding better educational and occupational opportunities to break the cycle of poverty and afford housing outside of ghettos, only to be racially profiled and placed in residentially segregated communities.  Thus, race-based residential segregation perpetuates poverty and racism and is distinguished as a prevalent characteristic of racial inequality in the United States.</p>
